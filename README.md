$6^{th}$ Form Final project

# The Task 
- The objective of this project was to design and implement a **database system** tailored to solve a real-world problem for a company. The project involved several key stages:

1. **Requirement Gathering**:  
   I conducted research to gather data about the company, its operations, and its specific needs. This information was used to design a custom solution that addressed the challenges faced by the company.

2. **System Design & Development**:  
   Using the gathered data, I developed a comprehensive database system that could manage and organize the company's data efficiently. The system was designed with user-friendly functionality in mind, ensuring that it could be easily operated by non-technical users.

3. **Testing (Blackbox Testing)**:  
   To ensure the system worked correctly, I applied **blackbox testing** methods. This involved testing the system's functionality without looking at the internal code structure, ensuring it met the user requirements and performed as expected in a real-world scenario.

4. **Project Report (not currently available)**:  
   The project culminated in a detailed written report that explained each aspect of the development process. This included a breakdown of the system's design, functionality, testing results, and the overall success of the solution in meeting the company's needs.

 # The Code

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **Python**: Used for the backend logic, managing the flow of data between the user interface and the database.
- **Tkinter**: A Python library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). This allowed users to interact with the database system through a simple and intuitive interface.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database system used to store and manage the company's data. It provided efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring the system could handle the required tasks reliably.

The combination of these technologies allowed the creation of a fully functional database system that could meet the needs of the company while being easy to use and maintain.

**Mark:** For this project  I achieved an 80/100
